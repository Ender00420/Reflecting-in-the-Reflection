This way, everyone has a chance to voice their thoughts while also contributing to a collaborative solution.\n\n2. **Rotate responsibilities**: By rotating roles within group work, such as facilitator or note-taker, every student can actively participate and feel invested in both their individual concerns and the group\u2019s learning objectives.\n\n3. **Thematic focus**: I would align individual concerns with broader themes in the curriculum. For example, if a student's concern relates to internet reliability, we could explore that topic together, ensuring all students see its relevance in the context of overall learning.\n\n4. **Shared experiences**: Integrating activities that focus on collective problem-solving can engage students in real-world scenarios where they can contribute their perspectives while working toward common goals.\n\n5. **Feedback sessions**: Regularly scheduled check-ins where we collectively reflect on the progress made on individual concerns can help maintain engagement and adapt lessons according to student needs.\n\nBy providing these opportunities for shared experiences, I can foster a sense of community while ensuring individual concerns are addressed within the context of our collective learning objectives."

When conflicts arise, I will encourage students to use \"I\" statements to express their viewpoints, which promotes personal ownership of opinions (e.g., \"I believe...\" or \"I feel...\"). Additionally, I will guide students in practicing active listening, where they summarize the opposing view before responding, fostering understanding and respect.\n\nI will also create \"debate\" style sessions, where students can explore conflicting perspectives on aspects of decentralization and data routing, framed as a way to deepen their understanding rather than win an argument.
