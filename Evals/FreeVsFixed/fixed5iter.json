Providing specific prompts related to data privacy, service reliability, and access inequality can help guide their conversations.\n\n2. **Think-Pair-Share Activity**: Implementing a think-pair-share approach will allow students to first reflect individually on their thoughts before discussing them with a partner. This fosters a safe environment for sharing ideas and encourages deeper contemplation.\n\n3. **Concept Mapping**: Encouraging students to create concept maps that visually link decentralization, servers, routers, and their real-world implications can help them organize their thoughts comprehensively. This visual strategy supports connections between ideas and enhances retention.\n\n4. **Reflective Journals**: Utilizing reflective journals where students can write personal responses to the prompt encourages them to explore their thoughts in-depth. They can use these journals to make connections to the original concepts and develop their understanding over time.\n\nBy employing these strategies, students will be able to articulate their insights more effectively and strengthen their understanding of how decentralization interacts with the core elements of the internet."
